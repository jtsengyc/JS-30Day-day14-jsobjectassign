    // start with strings, numbers and booleans

    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.

    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    const newArr0 = players;
    // however what happens when we update that array?
    newArr0[0] = 'test';
    // now here is the problem!
    console.log(newArr0);
    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!
    console.log(players);
    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

    // one way
    const newArr1 = players.slice(0);
    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const newArr2 = [].concat(players);

    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const newArr3 = [...players];
    const newArr4 = Array.from(players);

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed
    newArr1[0] = newArr2[0] = newArr3[0] = newArr4[0] = 'no change'
    console.log(players);
    console.log(newArr1);
    console.log(newArr2);
    console.log(newArr3);
    console.log(newArr4);
    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object
    const person = {
        age: 1, name: 'john'
    }
    // with Objects

    // and think we make a copy:
    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const person1 = Object.assign({}, person, {age: 3});

    console.log(person);
    console.log(person1);
    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
